## Story
You wonder why I choose exactly them over the thousend available sources out there?

###### Hazel
In my opinion the developer of Hazel known as "TheCherno" is one of the best teachers related to game engine development. I'm following his exams on youtube and got a good overview on how to even structure a game engine or how to write efficient code.
> Therefore big thanks to you and your community!
