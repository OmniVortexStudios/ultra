> Attention: Currently under construction and in an early-stage.

This projects mirrors my desire to get into game engine development since I was a child. As everyone knows, this is a task which will take some years, but as long as I have fun while coding, it doesn't realy matter.

## Project Goal ##

- A game engine which runs on any platform and with any api.
- A designer which fullfills anyones needs.
- Not a Unity, Unreal, etc replacement, rather like something which can coexist for "have-fun" projects.

> If you are interested in my odyssey feel free to follow it.

## Features ##
> Note: Windows implementation will be the first implemented.
