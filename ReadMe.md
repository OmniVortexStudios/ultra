> Attention: Currently under construction, heavy development, and in an early stage.
This project was restarted from scratch. Switch to the 'prototype' branch to get the most out of it.

The reason I started this game engine framework is simple: it's fun, and I enjoy coding it. <br/>
<br/>
So, no, I'm not reinventing the wheel. Look at the current market – every day, there is a "new" solution for existing problems.

## Build

Supported Development Environments:
- Visual Studio 2022 >v17.7

### VS2022
1. Execute 'prepare.bat' to build the Visual Studio solution.
2. Execute 'msbuild' in the developer console.

## Goals

This project primarily serves educational purposes, but there could be something interesting here and there. I want to achieve the following:
- A game engine framework that runs on nearly any platform and with any API
- A game editor that fulfills anyone's needs and is easy to use
- Not a replacement for Unity, Unreal, etc., but something that can coexist for "have-fun" projects


## Features
> Note: The main development platform is Windows. Therefore, everything will be implemented on it first.

I'm implementing features that interest me. For everything else, I use libraries like everyone else.

### @Work
Everything around the application and renderer itself.

### Planned
A lot, until I'm satisfied with the result!

# Disclaimer
This project uses several [third-party](3rd-Party/3rd-Party.md "3rd-Party") libraries.
