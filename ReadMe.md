> Attention: Currently under construction, heavy-development and in an early-stage.

This projects mirrors my odyssey to get into game engine development since I was a child. As everyone knows, this is a task which will take some years, anyways as long as I have fun while coding, it doesn't realy matter.

## Project Goal ##
This project currently serves primarily for educational purposes.

- A game engine which runs on nearly any platform and with any API.
- A game designer which fullfills anyones needs.
- Not an Unity, Unreal, etc replacement, rather like something which can coexist for "have-fun" projects.

## Features ##
> Note: The main development platform is Windows, therefore everything will be implemented there first.
